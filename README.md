# Portfolio Website

Code for my [portfolio](https://aaronhsieh.com/). This website is inspired by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), but I wanted something more minimal and in my own preferred style.

## How to use

There are 3 files that you need to edit:
- `config.yaml` for sidebar content
- `about.md` for about me section
- `publications.md` for selected publications

## Testing
To run a local instance for testing, run:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

And go to `http://localhost:8000/` to view the website.
