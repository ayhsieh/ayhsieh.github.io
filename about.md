# About me

I’m a first-year medical student at Penn (Perelman). My research interests are in medical AI applications, explainability, and safety. I am part of the [PCASO lab](https://www.pcasolab.org/) advised by Daniel Hashimoto. I'm also a VP of curriculum @ [PennHealthX](https://www.pennhealthx.com/). I have interned at Meta (Instagram) and Snap, where I worked on ML ranking and infra. Prior to med school, I was a full-time software engineer at Bloomberg building data classification systems.

For undergrad, I studied computer science, math, and biology at NYU. I was part of the [CN<sup>3</sup> lab](https://cn3laboratory.org/home.html) advised by Zhe Sage Chen, where I worked on ML for risk prediction of SUDEP and chronic back pain. I was also a [GLASS Scholar](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/undergraduate/glass) and a (very slow) NCAA swimmer.

I've always considered becoming a doctor; I was premed throughout undergrad. However, I was only 80% sure. It wasn't until I became a full-time programmer, when a long-term career in tech became more tangible, that I realized I wanted something more. I locked in, applied, and (somehow) got into medical school.

I am the proud father of two (feline) daughters, [Kirby and Nori](https://www.instagram.com/kirbyxnori/). My favorite shows of all time are Arcane and [Andor](https://www.instagram.com/reels/DQOV1Eyjrq3/).
