Hi there! I'm Aaron. My middle name is Yaoyang, which comes from my Chinese name 謝曜揚. I was named after Aaron Copland, one of my dad's favorite composers.

I'm a first-year medical student at UPenn (Perelman). For undergrad, I studied computer science, math, and biology at NYU. I am interested in using machine learning to improve the delivery of healthcare.
